# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze school disctrict data and school performance based on key point value, which will help the board of DOE to determine the budgets and funding of each school based on the performance. 

## Results

1. How is the district summary affected?
As shown in the table below, the total budget for this district where there are 15 schools with total 39,170 students is $24,649,428.00. Although the percentage of pass math and reading are 74.8% and 85.7, the percentage of overall passing is only 64.9%. This can mean that some students may not receive a score.

2.How is the school summary affected?



3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The percentage of passing rate for math, reading and overall scroes would be among the other Charter schools given there were missing scores for the 9th grader at Thomas High School which this wasn't the excat total number of students who have received a grades. As result, this may caused the passing rate at THS to be inaccurate. 

4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type
